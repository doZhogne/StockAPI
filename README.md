# StockAPI

Yahoo Stock API

Three service MOA that takes an user's name and stock (GOOG, etc.). 
It will give you the price for that particluar stock (see issue 1.).

This is a tutuorial I coded to help better understand Spring framework. Credit: TechPrimers.  

Issues: 
1. Yahoo Finance API is down. (Will need to use another API, currently working another project.)
2. Need to set up password for the db-service (application.properties files).
3. To develop front-end, been testing using Postman.
